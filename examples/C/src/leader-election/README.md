# Leader Election

These federated programs implements a redundant fault-tolerant system where a primary node, if and when it fails, is replaced by a backup node. The protocol is described in this paper:

> Bjarne Johansson; Mats RÃ¥gberger; Alessandro V. Papadopoulos; Thomas Nolte, "Consistency Before Availability: Network Reference Point based Failure Detection for Controller Redundancy," Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), 12-15 September 2023, [DOI:10.1109/ETFA54631.2023.10275664](https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA54631.2023.10275664)


The key idea in this protocol is that when a backup fails to detect the heartbeats of a primary node, it becomes primary only if it has access to Network Reference Point (NRP), which is a point in the network. This way, if the network becomes partitioned, only a backup that is on the side of the partition that still has access to the NRP can become a primary. If a primary loses access to the NRP, then it relinquishes its primary role because it is now on the wrong side of a network partition. A backup on the right side of the partition will take over.  The "FD" in the names of the programs stands for "fault detection."

## Prerequisite

To run these programs, you are required to first [install the RTI](https://www.lf-lang.org/docs/handbook/distributed-execution?target=c#installation-of-the-rti) (the Run-Time Infrastructure), which handles the coordination.

## Examples

<table>
<tr>
<td> <img src="img/NRP_FD.png" alt="NRP_FD" width="100%"> </td>
<td> <a href="NRP_FD.lf"> NRP_FD.lf </a>: This version has switch1 failing at 3s, node1 failing at 10s, and node2 failing at 15s.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <img src="img/NRP_FD_PrimaryFails.png" alt="NRP_FD_PrimaryFails" width="100%"> </td>
<td> <a href="NRP_FD_PrimaryFails.lf"> NRP_FD_PrimaryFails.lf </a>: This version has the primary (node1) failing after 5 seconds and the backup (node2) failing at at 15s.  The backup detects simultaneous loss of the heartbeat on both networks and hence assumes that the primary has failed rather than there being a network failure. Switch 1 remains the NRP.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <img src="img/NRP_FD_Partitioning.png" alt="NRP_FD_Partitioning" width="100%"> </td>
<td> <a href="NRP_FD_Partitioning.lf"> NRP_FD_Partitioning.lf </a>: This version partitions the network and shows that the protocol prevents the backup from becoming primary, thereby preventing two primaries.</td>
</tr>
